#### 24 April 2022 - Extension to second order dynamical systems

You can now simulate second order dynamical systems in **ChoiRbot**! 
We also included a script to simulate double integrator systems. More content coming soon! 
You can try the new functionalities by downloading the *dev_quadrotor* branch in the *src* directory of your workspace:

	git clone -b dev_quadrotor https://github.com/OPT4SMART/ChoiRbot.git .
