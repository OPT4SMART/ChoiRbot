#### 6 April 2022 - Quadrotor Simulation and Control

We developed a simulator and flatness based controllers for quadrotors! 
You can try the new functionalities by downloading the *dev_quadrotor* branch in the *src* directory of your workspace:

	git clone -b dev_quadrotor https://github.com/OPT4SMART/ChoiRbot.git .

We also included a bearing formation control example with four quadrotors. Check it out by running

	ros2 launch choirbot_examples quadrotorbearingformationcontrol.launch.py

We are working to include a more realistic visualization and support to more recent ROS2 distros. More content coming soon!

#### 6 April 2022 - Extension to second order dynamical systems

You can now simulate second order dynamical systems in **ChoiRbot**! 
We also included a script to simulate double integrator systems. More content coming soon! 
You can try the new functionalities by downloading the *dev_quadrotor* branch in the *src* directory of your workspace:

	git clone -b dev_quadrotor https://github.com/OPT4SMART/ChoiRbot.git .
