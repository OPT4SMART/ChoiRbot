# Welcome to the ChoiRbot Page!


## What is ChoiRbot?
**ChoiRbot** is a ROS 2 package developed by [Andrea Testa](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.testa/en), [Andrea Camisa](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.camisa/en) and [Giuseppe Notarsefano](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/giuseppe.notarstefano/en) within the ERC excellence research project [OPT4SMART](http://opt4smart.dei.unibo.it/). The aim of **ChoiRbot** is to provide a comprehensive framework to easily simulate and run experiments on teams of cooperating robots, with a particular focus on peer-to-peer networks of robotic agents without a central coordinator.

If you are you using ChoiRbot in research work to be published, please cite the accompanying paper "_A. Testa, A. Camisa, G. Notarstefano_, ChoiRbot: A ROS 2 toolbox for cooperative robotics, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 6(2), 2714-2720, 2021". Find more [here](citeus).

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/OPT4SMART/ChoiRbot/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
