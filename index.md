# Welcome to the ChoiRbot Page!


## What is ChoiRbot?
**ChoiRbot** is a ROS 2 package developed by [Andrea Testa](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.testa/en), [Andrea Camisa](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.camisa/en) and [Giuseppe Notarsefano](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/giuseppe.notarstefano/en) within the ERC excellence research project [OPT4SMART](http://opt4smart.dei.unibo.it/). The aim of **ChoiRbot** is to provide a comprehensive framework to easily simulate and run experiments on teams of cooperating robots, with a particular focus on peer-to-peer networks of robotic agents without a central coordinator.


## What can you do with ChoiRbot?
With **ChoiRbot**, you can easily develop your new distributed optimization or control scheme on a real network of cooperating robots. Take a look at the following implementations!
