<h2 id="what-is-choirbot">What is ChoiRbot?</h2>
<p><strong>ChoiRbot</strong> is a ROS 2 package developed by <a href="https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.testa/en">Andrea Testa</a>, <a href="https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.camisa/en">Andrea Camisa</a> and <a href="https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/giuseppe.notarstefano/en">Giuseppe Notarsefano</a> within the ERC excellence research project <a href="http://opt4smart.dei.unibo.it/">OPT4SMART</a>. The aim of <strong>ChoiRbot</strong> is to provide a comprehensive framework to easily simulate and run experiments on teams of cooperating robots, with a particular focus on peer-to-peer networks of robotic agents without a central coordinator.</p>

<p>If you are you using ChoiRbot in research work to be published, please cite the accompanying paper “<em>A. Testa, A. Camisa, G. Notarstefano</em>, ChoiRbot: A ROS 2 toolbox for cooperative robotics, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 6(2), 2714-2720, 2021”.</p>
